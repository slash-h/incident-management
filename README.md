File or Folder | Purpose
---------|----------
`app/` | content for UI frontends goes here
`db/` | your domain models and data go here
`srv/` | your service models and code go here
`package.json` | project metadata and configuration
`.cdsrc.json` | CDS configuration for auth and external service integration
